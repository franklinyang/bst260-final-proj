## Background 

As the US is making greater strides towards a value based care system, it will become critical to understand the relationship between better outcomes and cost efficiency. When compared to other similar countries, the [US currently spends far more and has worse health outcomes](http://www.oecd.org/els/health-systems/Health-at-a-Glance-2013.pdf).

The current US healthcare system operates under a fee-for-service payment scheme, which encourages a "quantity over quality" approach to healthcare. When a hospital's payment depends on how *many* services they can provide and not the *value* of those services, the focus of care shifts from a patient-centric experience to a payment-centric experience. 

Using Medicare as a paradigm, we have examined the relationship between spending, outcomes, and other extrinsic driving factors of quality within states and hospitals. Furthermore, we have attempted to investigate the relationship between a state's healthcare policymaking behavior and their Medicare outcomes
